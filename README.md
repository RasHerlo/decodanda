```Decodanda``` is a best-practices-made-easy Python package that handles the most common issues in population decoding, including balancing the data to disentangle different variables and avoid confounding effects of correlated variables.

Please refer to examples.ipynb for some usage examples.

For a guided explanation of some of the best practices implemented by Decodanda, refer to my teaching material for the Advanced Theory Course in Neuroscience at Columbia University: https://tinyurl.com/ArtDecod
