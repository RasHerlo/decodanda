```Decodanda``` is a best-practices-made-easy Python package for decoding in neuroscience. 

The best practices handled by the package include:
- Balancing classes
- Cross validation
- Creation of pseudo-population data
- Null model to test significance of the performance
- Disentangling individual variables
- When handling multiple variables, ```Decodanda``` balances the data to disentangle the individual variables and avoid the confounding effects of correlated conditions.

Please refer to ```examples.ipynb``` for some usage examples.

For a guided explanation of some of the best practices implemented by Decodanda, you can refer to my teaching material for the Advanced Theory Course in Neuroscience at Columbia University: https://tinyurl.com/ArtDecod
